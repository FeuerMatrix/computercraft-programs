# ComputerCraft Programs by FeuerMatrix

Scripts I made that work with the Minecraft Mod "ComputerCraft" and its fork "CC: Tweaked".

## Installation

To install, execute "wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeuerMatrix/computercraft-programs/master/matrixscripts/installer.lua" in your preferred installation folder of the turtle.
Upgrading to a higher version can be done the same way.

## Miner
The miner is an excavation program that extracts all ores from a cube area with minimal block breaking.
The miner can be found at /matrixscrpits/turtle/miner/miner.lua relative to the installation destination.
